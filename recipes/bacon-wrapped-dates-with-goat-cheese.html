    <h2>They're tasty!</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>24 pitted dates</li>
        <li>4 ounces honey-flavored goat cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>8 slices bacon, cut into thirds crosswise</li>
        <li>24 toothpicks</li>
        <li>1/4 cup hot honey, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Using a paring knife, cut each date lengthwise through to the middle. Combine goat cheese and rosemary in a bowl until evenly mixed. Stuff each date with the goat cheese mixture. Wrap each date with a small piece of bacon and secure with a toothpick. Place on prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn on the broiler and place baking sheet 6 inches from heat. Broil until bacon is browned and slightly crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from oven and place on a serving platter; drizzle dates with hot honey.</li>
    </ol>
